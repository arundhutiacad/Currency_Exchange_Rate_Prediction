# Currency_Exchange_Rate_Prediction

### Overview
Welcome to the Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Prediction project! This project focuses on predicting the exchange rate of a foreign currency (specifically, Indian Rupee - INR) using three different approaches: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), ARCH (AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity), and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model. By utilizing these methods, we aim to forecast future exchange rates, enabling individuals and businesses to make informed decisions in the dynamic world of currency trading.

### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop accurate and reliable models for predicting the future exchange rates of Indian Rupee against a selected foreign currency. These predictions can be valuable for financial analysts, investors, and businesses that engage in international trade. By leveraging historical exchange rate data, we can analyze patterns and trends to create models that provide insightful forecasts.

### Approaches
- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
ARIMA is a classical time series forecasting technique that combines autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components with differencing to stabilize non-stationary data. It is effective in capturing linear relationships in time series data and can provide short-term predictions.

-  ARCH (AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)
ARCH models are used to predict volatility in financial time series data. They focus on modeling the conditional variance of the series, which is particularly useful for capturing changing levels of volatility over time.

-  LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Network Model
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed for sequence data. It excels in capturing long-term dependencies and patterns in time series data. LSTMs are particularly powerful when dealing with complex relationships and non-linear dynamics.
